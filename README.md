Code for experiment

For Figure 1, the code is located at Code/Node classification/5-layer GCN/(2-class) (loop) GCN_KarateClub_Kronecker_compare.py
For Figure 2, the code is located at Code/Link prediction/5-layer GCN/(small_general_loop) Kronecker_vs_auto_5_layer.py
To run (small_general_loop) Kronecker_vs_auto_5_layer.py, the user needs to download the DDI_100_nodes.pkl located at Code/Link prediction/ and replace the string on the right-hand side of the equal sign at the 10th line of the code to the file location of your downloaded DDI_100_nodes.pkl.

For Figure 3 (a), Figure 4, and Figure 6 (a), the code is located at Code/Node classification/1-layer GCN/2 class of GCN_KarateClub_compare.ipynb
For Figure 3 (b), Figure 5, and Figure 6 (b), the code is located at Code/Node classification/2-layer GCN/Small of Link_prediction_Kronecker_vs_auto_drug.ipynb
The file DDI_100_nodes.pkl located at Code/Link prediction/ needs to be uploaded when runing Small of Link_prediction_Kronecker_vs_auto_drug.ipynb.
